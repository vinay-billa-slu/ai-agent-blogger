diagnose_wp.py (removed functionality)

This file previously contained an XML-RPC diagnostic tool. The project has been
converted to use email-based posting only (WordPress "Post by Email").

If you need to diagnose SMTP or Post-by-Email issues, use the instructions in
`EMAIL_POSTING_GUIDE.md` and the existing `test_content_generation.py` script.
